### Classifying the Genre of Songs

This repo contains examples of two approaches to classifying song genre that were assignments for my Data Science MSc. One method uses a gradient oosted model applied to lyric and sound related features of songs, another uses deep learning applied to spectrograms created from 15 second snippets of songs.
Exploratory data analysis is also included which was used on the lyric/sound dataset to inform the model refinement process.
